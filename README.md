###An educational game to help children learn about animal protection

#####Created as a project for my Grade 9 computer science class.
###Running Requirement
It is designed to run on [OLPC](http://one.laptop.org/), an educational laptop for children. It can also run on OSX, Windows and Linux as long as Python 2.x is installed.
It requires [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/) and [Pygame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html) to run. Please check your python version, make sure it is 2.x.
###Game purpose:
To educate young kenyans that continuous hunting of this beautiful creature may cause extinction.

###Game Overview
The game will look somewhat like this except with a Poacher with a gun on the top left side of the screen and a rhino nearby attempting to get away from the poacher. There will be a random word wrapped in a bubble that will appear on the screen. The player will type the word before the timer expires or the poacher will get closer to the rhino. It will be game over if the poacher touches the rhino. If the player types the word correctly and before the timer expires, the rhino will move 2 steps to the right. You win if the rhino reaches the end of the trail. We also made the poacher look very mean and scary to show the kids that these are very bad people. We made the typing section of the game very relevant to the topic of rhinos and
