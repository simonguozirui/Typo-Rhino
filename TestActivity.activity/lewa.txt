Did you know that the full name for Rhinos is Rhinoceros? Also did you know that rhinoceros means nose-horn? Rhinos are very big but are very gentle and friendly animals. They are the second biggest land animal! The white rhino are very heavy! They can weigh up to 3500 kilograms! Also, Rhinoceros have thick and rough skin to protect them from danger. Rhinos have very small brains so they are not very smart.  Rhinoceros horns are made from keratin, the same material that our fingernails and hair are made of. Rhinoceros are herbivores (they eat plants). White Rhinoceros are actually gray. The white rhino are very friendly and beautiful animals, but sadly, they are being hurt for only their very large horns.  Poachers are bad people kill a lot of White Rhinos. They kill the rhinos because they can make a lot of money if they sell the rhino horn. Each year more than 1100 rhinos are killed by poachers. Poachers only kill rhinos because they are very poor. Help the poachers so they will not have to kill rhinos.
